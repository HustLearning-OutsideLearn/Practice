The truncation trick resamples the noise vector $z$ from a truncated normal distribution which allows you to tune the generator's fidelity/diversity. The truncation value is at least 0, where 1 means there is little truncation (high diversity) and 0 means the distribution is all truncated except for the mean (high quality/fidelity). This trick is not exclusive to StyleGAN. In fact, you may recall playing with it in an earlier GAN notebook."
